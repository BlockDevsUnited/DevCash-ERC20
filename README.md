# DevCash-ERC20

This is the repo for the DevCash Token Contract.

### What's DevCash?

DevCash is cash for the developer economy.

DevCash is an ERC20 token (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20) in the Ethereum network. It can be transferred to and from Ethereum addresses at any time.

Devcash is intended to incentivize proper Blockchain developer training, grant access to developer resources, and act a medium of exchange in the developer marketplace.

### How can I get some?

Initially the total DevCash supply was allocated to the creator of this contract in Ethereum's mainnet, from there DevCash will be distributed through bounties at "Blockchain Developers United" and affiliated meetups.

Participation, content creation, community building, or mere attendance can be all good enough reasons to get some DevCash, but it's our hope that this token will become a powerful incentive to turn lurking learners into productive contributors.
